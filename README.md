# Jam Alert

Warning: Work in progress!!!

This is a holiday project meant to answer the question: "How can I find out if there are some people on [Jamulus](https://jamulus.io/) that I can jam with without looking at [Jamulus.live](https://jamulus.live/)"? I'm a bass player, so I'm really looking for servers where a couple people have gathered without a bass player. If there's a drummer, even better.

The goal here is to have something ambient, like a light or something. For that, I think I'll try using a Raspberry Pi. First, I needed to get the data though. Thanks to [jamulus-php](https://github.com/softins/jamulus-php) doing the heavy lifting here. That gets the Jamulus server data in JSON format so I can look through it periodically to find servers close to me that currently have some people connected to them.

Stay tuned for the ambient part.
